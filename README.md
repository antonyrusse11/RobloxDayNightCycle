Dynamic Day/Night Cycle System for Roblox
A robust and highly customizable day/night cycle script designed for Roblox experiences, ensuring a synchronized and immersive environmental ambiance across all players.

‚ú® Features
Automated Time Progression: Seamlessly transitions ClockTime from dawn to day, dusk, and night, looping continuously.

Server-Synchronized: Ensures all players in the game experience the exact same time of day and lighting conditions.

Configurable Cycle Length: Easily adjust how long a full 24-hour in-game day takes in real-world minutes.

Dynamic Lighting & Atmosphere: Automatically changes Lighting properties (Ambient, OutdoorAmbient, ColorShift_Top, ColorShift_Bottom) to match the time of day.

Smooth Transitions: Utilizes Roblox's TweenService for gradual, visually appealing fades between day and night lighting presets.

Customizable Presets: Define your own DayColors and NightColors to perfectly match your game's aesthetic.
